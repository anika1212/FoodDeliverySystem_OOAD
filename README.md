This project implements a Food Ordering and Delivery System using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern. It provides a command-line interface (CLI) for customers and delivery personnel to interact with the system.

The system supports the following key use cases:

1)Placing an Order

2)Tracking an Order

3)Completing a Delivery

4)Reviewing an Order

The system also integrates with a MySQL database to manage orders, status updates, and reviews.
